# xCT

 A complete modified verison of xCT to suit my personal preferences.

 xCT is a minimal combat text addon for [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/).

## Info:

 - Support [World of Warcraft - Battle of Azeroth (Patch 8.1)](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/)

 - xCT has a AoE spam merge and a healing spell filter functions that have to be configure by respective spellID. Right now, only Druid, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Shaman and Warrior were configured.

 **obs.:** for class configuration see file [filters.lua](https://github.com/PedroZC90/xCT/blob/master/config/filters.lua).
