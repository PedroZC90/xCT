# xCT

## Description:

 - xCT is a minimal combat-text addon.
 - This xCT version was edited/rewriten by me to make it works with my oUF layout [oUF_Lua](https://github.com/PedroZC90/oUF_Lua).

## Features:

 - This xCT version just handles incoming/outgoing damage and healing.
 - It also handle aoe spam for all frames, printing a total value and the number of values counted. (it's necessary add it spellID at AOE_SPAM table at 'config.lua')
 - It can also hide/filter specific healing spells. (It's necessary add spellID to the HEAL_FILTER table at 'config.lua')
 - there is just spell from Priest, Monk, Druid and Shaman.
 - Frames:
	1: incoming damage
	2: incoming healing only (self heal included)
	3: outgoing damage/healing
